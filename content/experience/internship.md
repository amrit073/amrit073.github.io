### Description

### 
I am currently an intern at <b> ðŸ”—[Codniv Innovations](https://codniv.com/) </b>, software company based in Basundhara, Kathmandu. 
<!-- - Developed an event-driven serverless integration framework using AWS services like **AppFlow**, **S3**, **Lambda** and **EventBridge**, to sync customer data between Salesforce and BuyerAssist. Through this, I learned to build systems to support bi-directional sync of large volumes of data from multiple sources, perform **CRUD** operations on **MongoDB** as well as **schema design**. -->
<!-- - Developed a configuration-driven framework to extend the pattern matching capability of **AWS EventBridge**, which **prevented thousands of false invocations of AWS Lambda functions**. -->
<!-- - Implemented a system to track asynchronous data transfer jobs through AWS AppFlow, which **saved hours of debugging time**. -->
<!-- - Developed a **Salesforce app** using SFDX to provide clients with a customized experience within their Salesforce dashboard. -->
<!-- - Developed a **Slack bot** to send interactive daily notifications to customers, and to allow them to take actions directly from Slack. This eliminated the operational resistance and **increased the adoption of our product by over 50%**. -->
<!-- - Implemented authorization for Slack integration with BuyerAssist using **React** and **OAuth 2.0** -->
<!-- - Mentored a new recruit for a period of 1 month -->

** YET TO BE FILLED **
