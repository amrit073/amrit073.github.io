### Description

### 
I have used both Nosql and Sql databases as mine projects demands.

I have been using Postgres as primary databases for projects during my internship period. I have dealt with migrations, triggers and normalizations postgres. I have experience of both raw and orm (knex) based query of databases I have used.

I had used Mongodb with mongoose orm for my personal Projects.

I have experience working with Redis in some of my personal Projects.

Database frameworks I am experienced with
- Knex / Bookshelf -> pg + mysql
- Sequelize -> pg + mysql
- Mongoose -> Mongodb

Tools I have used for databases operations:
- PGadmin
- psql terminal 
- Mongodb compass 
- dbeaver
