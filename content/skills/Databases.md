### Description

### 
With over a year of experience, I have worked extensively with various flavors of databases, including both SQL and NoSQL databases.

During my internship, I primarily used Postgres for projects, where I gained experience in migrations, triggers, and normalizations. I have also worked with both raw and ORM (Knex) based queries for Postgres and MySQL. In my personal projects, I have used MongoDB with Mongoose ORM and Redis for caching.

Some of the database frameworks I am proficient in include:

Knex / Bookshelf -> PostgreSQL + MySQL

Sequelize -> PostgreSQL + MySQL

Mongoose -> MongoDB

For database operations, I have used a variety of tools such as PGadmin, psql terminal, Mongodb compass, and DBeaver. My experience with these tools has enabled me to manage and operate databases efficiently and effectively.
