### Description

### 
 I have been using linux as my primary OS for more than two years. During this period, I have learned to be comfortable with commandline tools and terminal. I have been using bash for automating repetative actions I need to do in daily life. Some of my scripts I use with my machine shortcuts :
- ðŸ”—[IndexScrap.sh](https://github.com/amrit073/MegaIndexScrap) :  Recursively download files from an index. 
- ðŸ”—[TUnotice.sh](https://github.com/amrit073/scripts/blob/master/tunotice.sh) : For checking if TU has published new notice. It regularly checks notice and notifies me only of there is something new.
- ðŸ”—[Run.sh](https://github.com/amrit073/scripts/blob/master/run.sh) : Alternative for VScode live server. It watches for file changes, automatically switches to browser window showing new changes. It comes handy when working with frontend projects.
- ðŸ”—[Samachar.sh](https://github.com/amrit073/scripts/blob/3672619cd8683e0391255a102edde92c41ce7d7a/samachar.sh) : Fetch news from onlinekhabar rss, extract headlines and show it in notifications
