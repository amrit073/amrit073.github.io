### Description

### 
 With over two years of experience, I am well-versed in the Linux command-line environment and shell scripting. As a primary user of Linux OS, I have gained a deep understanding of various command-line tools and their terminal usage. 

I have used bash to automate repetitive actions in my daily life, and have created several scripts that I use with machine shortcuts, such as:
- ðŸ”—[IndexScrap.sh](https://github.com/amrit073/MegaIndexScrap) :  Recursively download files from an index. 
- ðŸ”—[TUnotice.sh](https://github.com/amrit073/scripts/blob/master/tunotice.sh) : Regularly checks for new notices from TU and notifies me only if there is something new.
- ðŸ”—[Run.sh](https://github.com/amrit073/scripts/blob/master/run.sh) : Alternative to VScode live server. It watches for file changes and automatically switches to a browser window showing the new changes. It is handy when working with frontend projects.
- ðŸ”—[Samachar.sh](https://github.com/amrit073/scripts/blob/3672619cd8683e0391255a102edde92c41ce7d7a/samachar.sh) :  Fetches news from the onlinekhabar RSS feed, extracts headlines, and shows them in notifications.
