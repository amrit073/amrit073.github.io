# Introduction
Working with json is always easier for me. That might be because I have not intensively tried to work with other format or because json is format of web. One thing awesome about json is how easy is it use to access values and do operations like mapping/looping through it. Postgres is one of few sql databasees that provides easy to use, fun to work with implementation of json format.
