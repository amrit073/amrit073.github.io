## Description

A todo app made with nodejs and mongodb database. I have used passportjs for social media based login.
I have used cookie-session to store user session. I used ejs for rendering todo list. 
This app stores todos of its user in mongodb atlas. It provides following functionalities: <br>
- Creating todos
- Deleting todos
- Marking todos as done

I have added dockerfile to this app hence  anybody can clone , run and test my todo app using docker.
